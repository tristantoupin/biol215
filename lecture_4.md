### Classification

#### What is classification?

  > Method for organizing information. We group similar organism together. Hitorically, phisical characteristics were used to make those categories.
  
  > Ideally, the categorization should reflect the evolutionary distances and relationships amoung organisms. It should even be able to predict future characteristics and understand the history of life.

#### Difficulty of Classifying Microorganisms

  > It is often hard to classify organism because they are slowly evolving. The transmission of genetic information captures ancestral relationships.
  
  > Morphologically simple organisms do not have obvious features to measure relatedness of species.
  
  
### Ancestral Organism and the Universal Tree of Life (a.k.a. UToL)

#### Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)

  > All organisms diverged from a common ancestor.

  > They all share: genetic code, mode of DNA replication, protein-synthesizing system, metabolic pathways, lipid bilayer and active transport.

#### Molecular Phylogeny (a.k.a. Molecula Ancestry)

  > RNA gene sequence identifies 3 major lineages:<br/>
      * Bacteria (prokaryote)
      * Archaea (prokaryote)
      * Eucarya (eukaryote)

### Horizontal Gene Transfer (a.k.a. HGT)

  > During endosymbiosis, genes were transferred from the endosymbiont to the host genome (EGT).
  
  > HGT is affected by plamid. Plasmids are small circular DNA particle that contains foreign genes that can be transferred.
  
  > __Facts:__ 20% of the E. Coli genome is traced to HGT
