# Radiations

>  __Adaptive Radiation:__ Evolutionary divergence of members of a single phylogenetic lineage into a variety of different adaptive forms over a relatively short interval of geological time.

## Advantages of Multicellularity




## Cambrian Radiation in Detail


| Eon | Era | Period | Epoch | Milions of Years Before Present | Duration in Millions of Years | Major Organic Events |
|:----|:----|:-------|:------|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:---------------------|
| Phanerozoic | Paleozoic | Silurian | n/a | 417 to 443 | 26 | First land plants. First land invertebrate. |
| Phanerozoic | Paleozoic | Devonian | n/a | 334 to 417 | 63 | Rise of fishes. First land vertebrate. |
| Phanerozoic | Paleozoic | Carboniferous | Mississippian | 320 to 354 | 34 | Development of amphibians and insects. |
| Phanerozoic | Paleozoic | Carboniferous | Pennsylvanian | 290 to 320 | 30 | Appearance of early reptiles. |
| Phanerozoic | Mesozoic | Jurassic | n/a | 142 to 2016 | 64 | Rise of giant dinosaurs. Appearance of birds. |
| Phanerozoic | Mesozoic | Cretaceous | n/a | 65 to 142 | 77 | Extinction of dinosaurs. First flowering plants. |
| Phanerozoic | Cenozoic | Tertiary | Paleocene | 55 to 65 | 10 | Radiation of primitive mammals. |


## Radiations of the History of Life

  > Radiation is appends because organism try to fill previously unavailable niches. It is a competitive advantage and release the specie from some competition.
  
### The Ediacaran Biota

  > The Ediacaran Biota is a diverse and enigmatic assemble of organisms. __They are not animals.__
  
  > They have no basic animal anatomical features. For instance, they have no eyes, no mouths, no anuses, no intestinal tracts nor locomotory appendages.
  
  > They are considered as an alternative early evolutionary experiment in multicellularity.

  > Here's an example of Ediacarans:

Here are some Ediacarans:

|     Name    | Image | Notes |
|:------------|-------|:------|
| Dickinsonia | ![alt text](lecture_data/Dickinsonia.png "Dickinsonia Fossil") | 1m of diameter and 3mm thick. |
| Spriggina | ![alt text](lecture_data/Spriggina.png "Spriggina Fossil") | The relationship with living animal is unclear. |


### The Burgess Shale Fauna

  > Found in the Yoho National Park in BC, Canada and 12 other sites worldwide.
  
  > The burges shale fauna are a group of organims that are crown taxa that already evelved the characters that define the phyla of living animals.
  
  > There are morphological gaps that separes these crown taxa.
