\section{Question 1}

What type of variation did the Authors’ find in natural populations of the ant Pheidole morrisi, which prompted the Author’s study \textbf{(1 mark)}? What is nature of the polyphenism found in Pheidole species \textbf{(1 mark)} and how did it help understand the developmental origin of the variation found in natural populations of the same species \textbf{(1 mark)}?

\section{Question 2}

What role do the vestigial wing discs play in unerstanding the developmental and evolutionary origin of super soldier ants in Pheidole \textbf{(2 marks)}?

\section{Question 3}

How did the Authors experimentally induce supersoldier-like ants in species that have not evolved them \textbf{(1 mark)}? Why do experimentally induced supersoldierlike ants have little vestigial wings \textbf{(0.5 mark)}? What conditions in nature may induce super soldier anomalies \textbf{(0.5 mark)} ?

\section{Question 4}

Give an example from the class on variation resulting from environmental cues that relates to this paper \textbf{(2 marks)}? Are the environmental cues the same or different as what was discussed in class \textbf{(1 mark)}?

\section{Question 5}

What is the definition of independent or parallel evolution \textbf{(1 mark)}? How many times did supersoldier ants evolve independently \textbf{(0.5 marks)}? What is ancestral developmental potential \textbf{(0.5 marks)}? How does ancestral potential change our idea of independent evolution \textbf{(2 marks)}?

\section{Question 6}

Why has the potential to induce supersoldiers in species that do not have them been retained for millions of years \textbf{(1 mark)}?

\section{Question 7}

Do other animals have ancestral developmental potential? If so, please give an example \textbf{(1 mark)}?
