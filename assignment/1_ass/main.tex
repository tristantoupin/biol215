\section{Question 1}

What type of variation did the Authors’ find in natural populations of the ant Pheidole morrisi, which prompted the Author’s study \textbf{(1 mark)}? What is nature of the polyphenism found in Pheidole species \textbf{(1 mark)} and how did it help understand the developmental origin of the variation found in natural populations of the same species \textbf{(1 mark)}?
\vspace*{20px}

\begin{myindentpar}{0.5cm}
They observed rare anomalous individuals which were much larger than the average soldier subcaste and add masothoracic wing vestiges. In many other \textit{Pheidole} species, supersoldier subcaste can be frequently observed and are often responsible for blocking the nest entrance and combat with army ant raids in order to protect their colony. The nature of this polyphenism begins with the larvae's nutrition which influence the juvinile hormones. Knowing this allowed the researcher to control the birth of these anomalous individuals and thus analysing them at different stage of their development.
\end{myindentpar}



\section{Question 2}

What role do the vestigial wing discs play in understanding the developmental and evolutionary origin of super soldier ants in Pheidole \textbf{(2 marks)}?
\vspace*{20px}

\begin{myindentpar}{0.5cm}
There is a precise observable pattern from these vestigial wing discs accross species at the development of the larvae stage. The authors here used this pattern and matched with hormonal manipulation and phylogenetic analysis, they were able to extend their observations to the anomalous supersoldier-like individual and conclude on the genetic accomodation of the species.
\end{myindentpar}



\section{Question 3}

How did the Authors experimentally induce supersoldier-like ants in species that have not evolved them \textbf{(1 mark)}? Why do experimentally induced supersoldierlike ants have little vestigial wings \textbf{(0.5 mark)}? What conditions in nature may induce super soldier anomalies \textbf{(0.5 mark)} ?
\vspace*{20px}

\begin{myindentpar}{0.5cm}
In order to experimentally induce supersoldier-like ants in species such as \textit{P. morrisi}, the auther exposed the larvae to methoprene. Methoprene is a JH analog that cause the larvae to develop into a supersoldier-like subcaste.

At the larvae stage, there are two JH-meditated switch point that will determines the subcaste of the subject. The queen has two complete wing dics with two hinges and two pouches. On the other hand, the minor worker has none of these (they are missing) and the soldier ants has a regular hinge but the pouch was not conservated at the larvae stage. It seems that the supersoldier-like individuals differ in their wing pouch expression of sal and the number of wing disc present at the larvae stage, causing the subcast to have little vestigial wings. 

There are several conditions that might of motivated the induction of the supersoldier-like subcats. This subcaste is induced when the larvae is developping through JH and may be influenced by nutrition. This is why the researcher used methoprene during their experience.

\section{Question 4}

Give an example from the class on variation resulting from environmental cues that relates to this paper \textbf{(2 marks)}? Are the environmental cues the same or different as what was discussed in class \textbf{(1 mark)}?

\begin{myindentpar}{0.5cm}
In class, we discussed the gene Pax6 (eyeless). This gene is highly conserved accross all animals but can give diffent result besed on environmental bias. For instance the human eye and the fly eye. In a broad sense, the environmental cues in both case were based on survival.
\end{myindentpar}



\section{Question 5}

What is the definition of independent or parallel evolution \textbf{(1 mark)}? How many times did supersoldier ants evolve independently \textbf{(0.5 marks)}? What is ancestral developmental potential \textbf{(0.5 marks)}? How does ancestral potential change our idea of independent evolution \textbf{(2 marks)}?

\section{Question 6}

Why has the potential to induce supersoldiers in species that do not have them been retained for millions of years \textbf{(1 mark)}?

\section{Question 7}

Do other animals have ancestral developmental potential? If so, please give an example \textbf{(1 mark)}?
