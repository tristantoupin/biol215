\section{Question 1}

What type of variation did the Authors’ find in natural populations of the ant Pheidole morrisi, which prompted the Author’s study \textbf{(1 mark)}? What is nature of the polyphenism found in Pheidole species \textbf{(1 mark)} and how did it help understand the developmental origin of the variation found in natural populations of the same species \textbf{(1 mark)}?


\section{Question 2}

What role do the vestigial wing discs play in unerstanding the developmental and evolutionary origin of super soldier ants in Pheidole \textbf{(2 marks)}?


\section{Question 3}

How did the Authors experimentally induce supersoldier-like ants in species that have not evolved them \textbf{(1 mark)}? Why do experimentally induced supersoldierlike ants have little vestigial wings \textbf{(0.5 mark)}? What conditions in nature may induce super soldier anomalies \textbf{(0.5 mark)} ?


\section{Question 4}

Give an example from the class on variation resulting from environmental cues that relates to this paper (2 marks)? Are the environmental cues the same or different as what was discussed in class \textbf{(1 mark)}?


\section{Question 5}

What is the definition of independent or parallel evolution \textbf{(1 mark)}? How many times did supersoldier ants evolve independently \textbf{(0.5 marks)}? What is ancestral developmental potential (0.5 marks)? How does ancestral potential change our idea of independent evolution \textbf{(2 marks)}?

\section{Question 6}

Why has the potential to induce supersoldiers in species that do not have them been retained for millions of years \textbf{(1 mark)}?


\section{Question 7}

Do other animals have ancestral developmental potential? If so, please give an example textbf{(1 mark)}?
