\section{Question 1}

What type of variation did the Authors’ find in natural populations of the ant Pheidole morrisi, which prompted the Author’s study (1 mark)? What is nature of the polyphenism found in Pheidole species (1 mark) and how did it help understand the developmental origin of the variation found in natural populations of the same species (1 mark)?
