# Speciation

__What is Speciation?__: It is the process by which new species arise.

  > There is a problem with the speciation which is there is no single definition that exists which applies equally to both secually and asexually reproducing individuals.
  
  > It can also be a challenge to define a species since they can be based on __Biological__, __Morphological__ or __phylogenetic__ (evolutionary development and diversification due to a feature).
