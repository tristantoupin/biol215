# Modern Diversity 2


## Some Facts

  > Between bacteria/archae, protist, fungi, plants and animals, the animals have the greatest number of species.
  
  > Between the mammals, the insects, the flatworms (platyhelminthes) and the mollusks (clams, snails) the insects have the greatest number of species (50%+).
  
  > Plants, animals and fungi are 3 kingdoms of the multicellular organisms.
  
  > Plants are known to evolve from organism similar to green algae. In fact, many plants reflect the transition from water to land.
  
  > Fungi are not simple plants, but a sister group of the animals.


## Animals
  
  > Hypotheized to evolve from the Choanoflagellates.
  
  > Animals obtain their energy from eating other organims
  
  > Cells that lack cell walls, and secrete an extracellular matrix consisting of collagen, integrins, glycoprotein and proteoglicans.

| Change name | Characteristics | Example |
|:------------|:----------------|---------|
| Ancestral Colonial Choanoflagellates | They are either solitary or colonial. They have flagella. They are heterotroph, meaning they can't produce their own food. They eat food by moving water towards them. |   ![alt text](lecture_data/Choanoflagellate_sol.png "Solitary Choanoflagellates") ![alt text](lecture_data/Choanoflagellate_col.png "Colonial Choanoflagellates") |
