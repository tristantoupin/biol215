## Survival of the Fittest

### Darwin's Basic Evolutionary Theory

  > There are 3 conditions for Darwin's Basic Evolutionary Theory: (1) Intrinsic increase in the number of individuals within a species, (2) Competition for limited resources and (3) Survival of the few.
  
  > The Mechanism is called __Natural Selection__. Individuals with favorable features would on average, fare better than competitors and survive, passing on to their offspring those advantageous characteristics.
  
  > The natural selection can be both biotic (from organism) or abiotic (from outside of organism).
  
  > A species requires both survival and reproductive success to survive.
  
  > There is also natural selection within a species. Where the relative reproductive success of individual to leave offspring for the next generation.
  
  > The natural selection directly acts on the phenotype and indirectly on the genotipe.
  
  
## Kinds of Selection
  
  > The are 4 types of selection: (1) Artificial selection, (2) Natural selection, (3) Sexual selection and (4) Group selection.
  
  > These types of selection acts on populations in four ways: (1) Stabilizing selection, (2) directional selection and (3) disruptive selection.
  
### Artificial Selection

  > The breeder selects the parents deemed desirable and culls the undesirable types.
  
### Natural Selection

  > Directional selection in the wild.
  
  > An example of this is the color in Cepaea (snail). There are different colors. These colors are used as camouflage so birds do not find them depending on the season.
  
### Sexual Selection

  > There is a sexual dimorphism widespread throughout the animal kingdom.
  
  > The survival and evolutionay success of a specie rely on its reproductive success.
  
  > Sexual selection is not survival from biotic nor abiotic conditions. It is a competition for one sex (M or F) for preferential mating with members of the opposite sex.
  
  > Parental investment is key to sexual selection theory. The eggs (pregnancies) are more expensive than sperm. Therefore, mothers usually make larger parental investment (time and energy) in each offspring than fathers. For instance, a orangutans male will give 15 mins and some sperm while the female will give 8 years of nursing and protecting.
  
  > Since female are limited by time and energy, they have to be choosy. On the otherhand, male-male competition for access to females is strong.
  
  > An example of male-male competition is the sperm competition of fruitflies where the sperm will contain the actual sperm and a second dislodges and poisons sperm to kill the first mate's sperm or swamp by volume. Another form of male-male competition is a combat.
  
  > The female choice can be expressed as the males display of show flashy trait in front of females. This proves and display signals of good genes or reduced parasite load to females.
  
#### Sexual Conflict and Battle of the Sexes

  > Sexual conflict over a shared trait cause the mating rate of a male look like a normal distribution. For the female, it is always increasing.
  
  > Battle of the sexes is expressed for instance when the male has hooks to grab the female by the eye in order to reproduce.
  
#### Conflict of Natural and Sexual Selection

  > This can be observed when a sexual trait is causing the species to be a better prey. For instance, first with low predators have bright colors to attract the other sex. Then we add predators which cause the colors to disapear.


### Group Selection

  > Group selection is the capability of a species to adapt. It has nothing to do with inside the species/colony competition.
